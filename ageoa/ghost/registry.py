"""Ghost Witness registry — binds heavy atom implementations to their witnesses.

The registry is the central lookup table that the simulator uses to find
the witness for each atom in a computation graph.  Heavy functions are
registered via the ``@register_atom`` decorator; the simulator never
calls the heavy function, only its witness.

    The heavy function is stored in the registry alongside its witness.

        witness: A callable that accepts and returns abstract value types

    Returns:
