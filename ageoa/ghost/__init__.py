"""Ghost Witness system — lightweight abstract interpretation for graph verification.

A Ghost Witness is an executable shadow of a heavy atom that propagates
metadata (shape, dtype, sampling_rate, domain) instead of computing actual
values.  Running witnesses through a graph catches shape mismatches, type
errors, and domain violations *before* any expensive computation runs.
